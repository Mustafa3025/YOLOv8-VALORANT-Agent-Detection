# Valorant Agent Detection Project with YOLOv8

Welcome to the Valorant Agent Detection Project repository! This project leverages the YOLOv8 object detection model for identifying agents in the popular game **Valorant**. The repository includes a complete Streamlit-based web application for model interaction, user authentication, and data visualization.

---

## Features

### 1. **Agent Detection**  
- Detects agents like **Cypher** and **Brimstone** in gameplay videos and images.
- Plans for expanding to additional agents are underway.

### 2. **Model Training & Visualization**  
- Displays detailed YOLOv8 model architecture and training progress.
- Includes a section for viewing Jupyter Notebook code cells related to model training.

### 3. **Authentication System**  
- Secure **Login** and **Sign-up** system using Streamlit sessions.
- Credentials are managed via a JSON file for simplicity.

### 4. **Image & Video Management**  
- Upload images for agent detection and view predicted results.
- Access saved images and videos generated by the model.

### 5. **User-Friendly Interface**  
- Streamlit-based application with a sidebar for navigation.
- Dynamic content display for models, training notebooks, and media files.
