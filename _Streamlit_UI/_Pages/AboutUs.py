    In this project, we utilize the **ModelV8 Small** architecture to train a custom model for detecting agents in the popular game *Valorant*. The model has been specifically trained on custom data, focusing on two agents **Cypher** and **Brimstone** with plans to expand to other agents in the future. By using ModelV8 Small, a lightweight version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, we can efficiently detect agents in real-time gameplay while maintaining a balance between performance and accuracy. The training involves annotating in-game images and finetuning the model to recognize each agent's unique characteristics and poses, making it highly effective for Valorant agent detection tasks.
